# DandD-5e-CR-Calculator
This is a personal project to help me get better with python. It is designed to calculate the challenge rating of monsters for Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition monsters. I plan to expand it to do more and be more user friendly.

At the moment, use the version that is in the .zip file, as that has been expanded to work with lower CR monsters and to give you the option to use save DCs, not just hit bonus.
Additionally, there is an addition of a if __name__ = "__main__", allowing for testing that doesn't get in the way of simply importing this file to another project.

IMPORTANT NOTE: do not run CRCalc without first running CRTableMaker. CRCalc assumes the database CRTableMaker creates is available.
